1. Var is scoped to the nearest function block and Let is scoped to the nearest 
enclosing block. But both are global if outside a block. example

FOR VAR
function byE40() {
    // x *is* visible out here

    for( var x = 0; x < 5; x++ ) {
        // x is visible to the whole function
    }

    // x *is* visible out here
}

FOR LET
function allyIlliterate() {
  // y is *not* visible out here

  for( let y = 0; y < 5; y++ ) {
    // y is only visible in here (and in the for() parentheses)
    //and there is a separate y variable for each iteration of the loop
  }

  // y is *not* visible out here
}

2. Global variabes defined with 'let' will not be added as properties on the global 
window object like the ones defined with 'var'. example

var varVariable = “this is a var variable”;
let letVariable = “this is a let variable”;

console.log(window.varVariable); //this is a var variable
console.log(window.letVariable); //undefined

3. Redeclaration 
	Assuming strict mode, 'var' will let you re-declare the same variable in the same scope 
	but 'let' won't allow you.
