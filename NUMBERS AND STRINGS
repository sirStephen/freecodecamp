Today I am going to talk about data types. I am picking the first common two. 
And they are numbers and strings. In Javascript, any value that is wrapped with
a '' or "" is a string. For instance, 

let name = 'Gregory';

Gregory becomes a string. 
name on the left hand side is name of the variable.
let is the es6 reserved word for storing variables.

But what happens when you do this;

let name = Gregory;

You will get an error from the browser console or terminal if you are using node
to run your javascript files. The errors will say something like this.

'ReferenceError: Gregory is not defined' and that is because when you created the 
variale called name, it was expecting a string which is normallly wrapped with '' 
or "".

NUMBERS
Numbers is also a data type in Javascript. It has almost same rules with strings data
type. The major difference is you are not allowed to wrapped your numbers in '' or "".
If wrapped, Javascript will see it as a string. example

let number = 1;

1 is a number;
number in the left hand side is name of the variable.
let is the es6 reserved word for storing variables.

more examples

let number = '1';
The above example is not number data type. Why??? because it is wrapped with a '' or "".

let number = 'one';
Also not a number.
