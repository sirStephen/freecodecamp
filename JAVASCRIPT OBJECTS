JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS

They are similar to arrays but instead of using indexes to access their data, you access them using their properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way.

Example,

let cat = {
	"name": "Cruffy",
	"legs": 4,
	"tails": 1,
	"enemies": ["water", "dogs"]
};

The properties are stored as strings eg "name", "legs" etc.

There are two ways to access the properties of an object.
Through dot notation(.) and bracket notation([]). Very similar to an array. 

Dot Notation(.) is used when you know the property you want to access. example

let myDog = {
	"name": "Black",
	"color": "black"
};

let nameOfMyDog = myDog.name; // Black
let colorOfMyDog = myDog.color; // color

Bracket Notation([]) is used when the property has a space between its name. However, you can still use this when there is no space in the property. example

let myDog = {
	"name of dog": "Black",
	"color of dog": "black"
};

myDog["name of dog"]; // Black
myDog["color of dog"]; // black
